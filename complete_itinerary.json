    "history": "Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe, predating many other modern European capitals. It has been inhabited since Neolithic times and later settled by Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans. In the 8th century, it was conquered by the Moors, who influenced its architecture and culture for centuries. In 1147, Afonso Henriques, the first King of Portugal, captured Lisbon, making it the capital of the Kingdom in 1255. During the Age of Discovery, Lisbon became a major trading center, accumulating wealth and power. The devastating earthquake of 1755 destroyed much of the city, leading to its reconstruction under the direction of the Marquis of Pombal. Today, Lisbon is a thriving metropolis and a major European tourist destination.",
